# AI School 2025

This page contains training materials for the [AI School at Leibniz IOM Leipzig](https://aischool.iom-leipzig.de/).

**Note: This page is under heavy construction**

## Target audience

The notebooks are written for scientists with basic knowledge of Python programming and are beginners in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). By the end of the training, active participants will have acquired fundamental knowledge in ML and AI. They will then know how to apply suitable ML/AI techniques to automatically process, analyze, and visualize data.
