# Introduction

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping of similar objects into sets. It can be employed for example to:
<ul>
<li>Identify groups in a data set</li>
<li>Support analyzing a data set</li>
<li>Label efficiently a data set in semisupervised approach</li>
<li>Segment an image by clustering the pixel color</li>
<li>Reduce the dimension of a data set</li>
<li>Detect outliers of a data set</li>
<li>Improve machine learning models by feature engineering</li>
</ul>

This section will introduce into following cluster approaches which are available in scikit-learn:
1. K-Means
2. Gaussian Mixtures
3. DBSCAN and HDBSCAN

An exercise will close this section.
