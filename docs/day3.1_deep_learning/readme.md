# Deep Learning

This session covers the theory and practice of deep learning. We will discuss architectures and the training process of neural networks and take a closer look at the implementation and training of a neural network for regression in a practical exercise using [pytorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intro.html) and doing hyperparameter optimization with [optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

Alternative libraries for hyperparameter optimization and more:
* [Ray with Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html)
* [Hyperopt](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/)
* [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/)
