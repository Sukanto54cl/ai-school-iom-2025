# Central steps

This session will introduce in programming a machine learning based code with scikit-learn (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">(link to library)</a>).
A regression model is used as example to outline the general workflow for a machine learning project. 
Following main steps are typical for a machine learning project:
1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Explore and visualize the data.
4. Prepare the data for the machine learning algorithm.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your model and make it ready for later usage.
   
We will go through them in the following.
