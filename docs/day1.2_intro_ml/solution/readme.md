We use following syntax for the file names:
04_excercise.ipynb: Solution for exercise in 04-exploredata.ipynb.
05_excersise.ipynb: Solution for exercise in 05-prepare-data.ipynb
13-exercise.ipynb: Solution for excersice in 13-reg-excercise.ipynb

Please note, last excercise (13) is slightly extended to show that providing too much input features can result 
in a decreased performance of models based on distances to neighbors (e.g. nearest neighbor regression or SVR with a RBF kernel).
