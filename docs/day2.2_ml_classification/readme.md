# Introduction

Classification is a supervised machine learning technique aiming to predict the correct class based on the provided input features. This section will introduce on training a model for classification. We will start with a binary classification algorithm that distinguishes between two classes. Typical performance measures will be introduced before we move on to multiclass classification.

The session was prepared by Dr. Stefan Zahn (IOM). If you have any questions, you can contact him.
