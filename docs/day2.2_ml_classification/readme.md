# Introduction

Classification is a supervised machine learning technique aiming to predict the correct class based on the provided input features. This section will introduce on training a model for classification. We will start with a binary classification algorithm that distinguishes between two classes. Typical performance measures will be introduced before we move on to multiclass classification.
